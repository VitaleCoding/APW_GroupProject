3/6/2024:
This collection of folders is currently made to be a skeleton to house the code. Next time we all meet we can discuss how we want everything in the project divvied up and organized but I wanted to just put out a rough draft of the rough draft so we can have some kind of visual while discussing the project. File and folder names and locations are subject to change as we work on this project together but for now there is a folder for:
1. Quiz data (questions and answers)
2. Website data (pulling the quiz data into the website formatting)
3. Leaderboard data (save results of each quiz attempt including what questions were given in that attempt. Could also pull this data to be displayed on the website).
My goal for all of us is to figure out the organization of files either before or during our next meeting together, and then start with the quiz questions and answers. I can handle the question data if need be, but the goal is to have anywhere from 50-55 questions in the pool to be pulled into a 15-20 question quiz.
